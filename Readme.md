# Automating Notion

This is a way of automating all processes in EllieGons HabitTracker Notion template. I love their work and thought that creating something like this to go along with it would be the cherry on top. Check out more of their stuff on their reddit profile: https://www.reddit.com/user/EllieGons/

# Getting Notion Setup
Add the habits template to your notion (https://elliegons.notion.site/Habits-Template-6b08b5491f40436faf7f8e1acbb6c5b5)

From here, the only thing you need to do manually is create your habits. Follow the examples in root -> habits and those DB objects will be used by the script. 

Optionally, you can add a "Days" property to the habit database and add days of the week you'd like the habit to be activated on as a comma separated list (ex: "Monday, Wednesday, Saturday" or just "Tuesday" or something along those lines, without the quotes) to override the habit's frequency. The days of the week you select will always take precedence over the habit's frequency.

Changing the Habit's status from "On" will prevent the script from creating daily entries for that habit.

The script also uses the habit's icon as the daily habit's icon. This is somewhat problematic when using external files. I'd recommend using the notion icons or emojis.

# Usage and Requirements
You'll need python and git. I know that a lot of people using this may not have a lot of programming experience or familiarity so I'll do my best to guide closely. You can skip to the code blocks if you feel confident in your system setup/API knowledge.
Get python here: https://www.python.org/downloads/
Install git with these instructions: https://github.com/git-guides/install-git

You'll need to create a Notion integration and give it access to your habit's page. Tutorial here: https://www.notion.so/help/create-integrations-with-the-notion-api

All functionality requires the use of your notion data. You'll need to add this into a file (henceforth referred to as a config) by following the next steps.
Open up a terminal window and copy these lines in one by one

    git clone https://github.com/CharliePalm/NotionHabitsIntegration
    cd NotionHabitsIntegration
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    python config.py
When creating your config, the script will ask you for several entity IDs. If you're unfamiliar with how to find them, you simply copy the link of the page and copy the first ID string. Basically, the link will look like:

    https://www.notion.so/{{user name}}/{{ID YOU WANT}}?v={{ID YOU DONT WANT}}
Just cut out {{ID YOU WANT}} and feed it to the script when prompted. It checks every ID you give it so you'll know if you make a mistake.

Then in that same terminal window

    python daily_job.py
Note that the daily_job script does NOT query your current habits and instead uses habits that it has loaded into the config to prevent bloating Notion's API. If you make changes to your habits that you'd like reflected by the daily_job script you can run config.py, choose correct existing data, and then option 5.

For those using this without much programming experience, when you run this process on a daily basis to generate your habits, you can just open a terminal window and the following:

    cd NotionHabitsIntegration
    python daily_job.py
If you're interested in automating this to run daily, that can be done quite easily through your OSs cron and is a quick google away. It's made my life a lot easier - would recommend!
